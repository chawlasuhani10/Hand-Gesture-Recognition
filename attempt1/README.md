### Attempt 1  
#### succeeded in the following-
1) Connected IMU sensor to ESP32-S2 via I2C
2) Supplied power
3) Utilized the ESP IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) to configure the I2C communication interface. Verfied communication works by 'Flash' and 'Monitor'
4) Collected hand movement data manually

#### failed 
to collect data automatically as soon as the sensor is connected. need a loop for that
